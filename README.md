# Data-Management-and-Beam-Diagnostics-in-Particle-Accelerators
I created this database management system for CSE 370: Database System course offered by BRAC University on Fall 2025. This database management system designed to store, organize, and manage experimental data generated from a particle accelerator. Particle accelerators are the world’s largest facilities to conduct experiments. Installed deep beneath the underground, the experiment conducted in such facilities aims to detect new fundamental building blocks of the universe, thus extending the current version of the Standard Model of particle physics and our understanding of the universe. In this project, I am interested in simulating a particle accelerator set up and creating a database management system that accommodates some of the basic functionality expected in managing such huge facilities. Some of the key features I am trying to implement are: 

* __View Apparatus Information__ – Show details of apparatus, their beams, and operating conditions. 

* __Manage Experiments__ – Add, edit, or view ongoing and completed experiments. 

* __Record Experimental Results__ – Upload new results with date, type, and outcome. 

* __Manage Facilities__ – Add or view laboratories, beamlines, or detectors. 

* __Manage Employees__ – Add new scientists, technicians, or staff. 

* __Search Functionality__ – Search by staff, experiment, detected particles, or available apparatus. 

* __Generate Summary Reports__ – Summarize experiments, results, and resource usage.

* __Export Data to CSV/PDF__
